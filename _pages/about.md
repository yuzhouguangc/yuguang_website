I am a postdoctoral scholar, advised by [H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor), in Department ofÂ Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I am also currently an NSF Intern Research Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Southern Methodist University.

My research interests are graph mining, reliability theory, machine learning, (geometric) deep learning, nonparametric statistics, topological data analysis, semi-supervised classification, and life-testing procedures, in application to power systems and blockchain.
