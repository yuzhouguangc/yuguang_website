I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University. Before joining Temple University, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar, advised by [H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor), in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I am also an NSF Research Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Southern Methodist University advised by [‪Hon Keung Tony Ng](https://s2.smu.edu/ngh/) and [Yulia R. Gel](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~yxg142030/).

My research interests are graph mining, reliability theory, machine learning, (geometric) deep learning, nonparametric statistics, topological data analysis, semi-supervised classification, and life-testing procedures, in application to power systems and blockchain.
