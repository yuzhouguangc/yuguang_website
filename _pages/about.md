I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in [Department of Computer and Information Sciences](https://cis.temple.edu/) at Temple University. I am also a Visiting Research Collaborator in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. Before joining Temple University, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar, advised by [H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor), in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Southern Methodist University advised by [â€ªHon Keung Tony Ng](https://s2.smu.edu/ngh/) and [Yulia R. Gel](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~yxg142030/).

My research interests are machine learning, deep learning, graph mining, topological data analysis, reliability theory, nonparametric statistics, and their applications. For more details, see my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/auavcmfxy9f5o3ihdaxd3/Feb-CV-YChen.pdf?rlkey=tlvaibhdqr8z452t8dr6tfwgy&dl=0).

#### [Recruiting New Students]()
I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven students, who are interested in machine learning, deep learning, data mining, and topological and geometric methods in statistics. If you are interested, please contact me. Include your CV and brief highlights of ML/DL/Statistics-related projects.
