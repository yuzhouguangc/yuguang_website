I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Department of Computer and Information Sciences at Temple University. Before joining Temple University, I worked as a postdoctoral scholar, advised by [H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor), in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I am also an NSF Research Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Southern Methodist University advised by [‪Hon Keung Tony Ng](https://s2.smu.edu/ngh/) and [Yulia R. Gel](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~yxg142030/).

My research interests are graph mining, reliability theory, machine learning, (geometric) deep learning, nonparametric statistics, topological data analysis, semi-supervised classification, and life-testing procedures, in application to power systems and blockchain.

#### [Recruiting New Students]()
I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven students, who are interested in machine learrning/deep learning on graphs, data mining, and topological and geometric methods in statistics. Master's and undergraduate students at Temple University, and self-funded visiting students and scholars are also welcome to apply. If you are interested, please contact me at [yuzhou.chen@temple.edu](yuzhou.chen@temple.edu). Include your CV and brief highlights of ML/DL/Statistics-related projects.
